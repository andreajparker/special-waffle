Explore trending papers, etc. over time on Reddit.

# About

This repo / project looks at trending papers and other online resources with a single URI and explores how their 'popularity' changes or remains static over time. Initially we'll focus on URIs such as links to arXiv.org papers on subreddits such as /r/languagetechnology, but we may expand the scope to other non-arXiv 'entities' and/or subreddits.
